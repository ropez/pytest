2.5.1
-----------------------------------

- merge new documentation styling PR from Tobias Bieniek.

- fix issue403: allow parametrize of multiple same-name functions within
  a collection node.  Thanks Andreas Kloeckner and Alex Gaynor for reporting
  and analysis.

- Allow parameterized fixtures to specify the ID of the parameters by
  adding an ids argument to pytest.fixture() and pytest.yield_fixture().
  Thanks Floris Bruynooghe. 

- fix issue404 by always using the binary xml escape in the junitxml
  plugin.  Thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt.

- fix issue407: fix addoption docstring to point to argparse instead of
  optparse. Thanks Daniel D. Wright.



2.5.0
-----------------------------------

- dropped python2.5 from automated release testing of pytest itself
  which means it's probably going to break soon (but still works
  with this release we believe).

- simplified and fixed implementation for calling finalizers when
  parametrized fixtures or function arguments are involved.  finalization
  is now performed lazily at setup time instead of in the "teardown phase".
  While this might sound odd at first, it helps to ensure that we are
  correctly handling setup/teardown even in complex code.  User-level code
  should not be affected unless it's implementing the pytest_runtest_teardown
  hook and expecting certain fixture instances are torn down within (very
  unlikely and would have been unreliable anyway).

- PR90: add --color=yes|no|auto option to force terminal coloring
  mode ("auto" is default).  Thanks Marc Abramowitz.

- fix issue319 - correctly show unicode in assertion errors.  Many
  thanks to Floris Bruynooghe for the complete PR.  Also means
  we depend on py>=1.4.19 now.

- fix issue396 - correctly sort and finalize class-scoped parametrized
  tests independently from number of methods on the class.

- refix issue323 in a better way -- parametrization should now never
  cause Runtime Recursion errors because the underlying algorithm
  for re-ordering tests per-scope/per-fixture is not recursive
  anymore (it was tail-call recursive before which could lead
  to problems for more than >966 non-function scoped parameters).

- fix issue290 - there is preliminary support now for parametrizing
  with repeated same values (sometimes useful to to test if calling
  a second time works as with the first time).

- close issue240 - document precisely how pytest module importing
  works, discuss the two common test directory layouts, and how it
  interacts with PEP420-namespace packages.

- fix issue246 fix finalizer order to be LIFO on independent fixtures
  depending on a parametrized higher-than-function scoped fixture.
  (was quite some effort so please bear with the complexity of this sentence :)
  Thanks Ralph Schmitt for the precise failure example.

- fix issue244 by implementing special index for parameters to only use
  indices for paramentrized test ids

- fix issue287 by running all finalizers but saving the exception
  from the first failing finalizer and re-raising it so teardown will
  still have failed.  We reraise the first failing exception because
  it might be the cause for other finalizers to fail.

- fix ordering when mock.patch or other standard decorator-wrappings
  are used with test methods.  This fixues issue346 and should
  help with random "xdist" collection failures.  Thanks to
  Ronny Pfannschmidt and Donald Stufft for helping to isolate it.

- fix issue357 - special case "-k" expressions to allow for
  filtering with simple strings that are not valid python expressions.
  Examples: "-k 1.3" matches all tests parametrized with 1.3.
  "-k None" filters all tests that have "None" in their name
  and conversely "-k 'not None'".
  Previously these examples would raise syntax errors.

- fix issue384 by removing the trial support code
  since the unittest compat enhancements allow
  trial to handle it on its own

- don't hide an ImportError when importing a plugin produces one.
  fixes issue375.

- fix issue275 - allow usefixtures and autouse fixtures
  for running doctest text files.

- fix issue380 by making --resultlog only rely on longrepr instead
  of the "reprcrash" attribute which only exists sometimes.

- address issue122: allow @pytest.fixture(params=iterator) by exploding
  into a list early on.

- fix pexpect-3.0 compatibility for pytest's own tests.
  (fixes issue386)

- allow nested parametrize-value markers, thanks James Lan for the PR.

- fix unicode handling with new monkeypatch.setattr(import_path, value)
  API.  Thanks Rob Dennis.  Fixes issue371.

- fix unicode handling with junitxml, fixes issue368.

- In assertion rewriting mode on Python 2, fix the detection of coding
  cookies. See issue #330.

- make "--runxfail" turn imperative pytest.xfail calls into no ops
  (it already did neutralize pytest.mark.xfail markers)

- refine pytest / pkg_resources interactions: The AssertionRewritingHook
  PEP302 compliant loader now registers itself with setuptools/pkg_resources
  properly so that the pkg_resources.resource_stream method works properly.
  Fixes issue366.  Thanks for the investigations and full PR to Jason R. Coombs.

- pytestconfig fixture is now session-scoped as it is the same object during the
  whole test run.  Fixes issue370.

- avoid one surprising case of marker malfunction/confusion::

      @pytest.mark.some(lambda arg: ...)
      def test_function():

  would not work correctly because pytest assumes @pytest.mark.some
  gets a function to be decorated already.  We now at least detect if this
  arg is an lambda and thus the example will work.  Thanks Alex Gaynor
  for bringing it up.

- xfail a test on pypy that checks wrong encoding/ascii (pypy does
  not error out). fixes issue385.

- internally make varnames() deal with classes's __init__,
  although it's not needed by pytest itself atm.  Also
  fix caching.  Fixes issue376.

- fix issue221 - handle importing of namespace-package with no
  __init__.py properly.

- refactor internal FixtureRequest handling to avoid monkeypatching.
  One of the positive user-facing effects is that the "request" object
  can now be used in closures.

- fixed version comparison in pytest.importskip(modname, minverstring)

- fix issue377 by clarifying in the nose-compat docs that pytest
  does not duplicate the unittest-API into the "plain" namespace.

- fix verbose reporting for @mock'd test functions

v2.4.2
-----------------------------------

- on Windows require colorama and a newer py lib so that py.io.TerminalWriter()
  now uses colorama instead of its own ctypes hacks. (fixes issue365)
  thanks Paul Moore for bringing it up.

- fix "-k" matching of tests where "repr" and "attr" and other names would
  cause wrong matches because of an internal implementation quirk
  (don't ask) which is now properly implemented. fixes issue345.

- avoid tmpdir fixture to create too long filenames especially
  when parametrization is used (issue354)

- fix pytest-pep8 and pytest-flakes / pytest interactions
  (collection names in mark plugin was assuming an item always
  has a function which is not true for those plugins etc.)
  Thanks Andi Zeidler.

- introduce node.get_marker/node.add_marker API for plugins
  like pytest-pep8 and pytest-flakes to avoid the messy
  details of the node.keywords  pseudo-dicts.  Adapated
  docs.

- remove attempt to "dup" stdout at startup as it's icky.
  the normal capturing should catch enough possibilities
  of tests messing up standard FDs.

- add pluginmanager.do_configure(config) as a link to
  config.do_configure() for plugin-compatibility

v2.4.1
-----------------------------------

- When using parser.addoption() unicode arguments to the
  "type" keyword should also be converted to the respective types.
  thanks Floris Bruynooghe, @dnozay. (fixes issue360 and issue362)

- fix dotted filename completion when using argcomplete
  thanks Anthon van der Neuth. (fixes issue361)

- fix regression when a 1-tuple ("arg",) is used for specifying
  parametrization (the values of the parametrization were passed
  nested in a tuple).  Thanks Donald Stufft.

- merge doc typo fixes, thanks Andy Dirnberger

v2.4
-----------------------------------

known incompatibilities:

- if calling --genscript from python2.7 or above, you only get a
  standalone script which works on python2.7 or above.  Use Python2.6
  to also get a python2.5 compatible version.

- all xunit-style teardown methods (nose-style, pytest-style,
  unittest-style) will not be called if the corresponding setup method failed,
  see issue322 below.

- the pytest_plugin_unregister hook wasn't ever properly called
  and there is no known implementation of the hook - so it got removed.

- pytest.fixture-decorated functions cannot be generators (i.e. use
  yield) anymore.  This change might be reversed in 2.4.1 if it causes
  unforeseen real-life issues.  However, you can always write and return
  an inner function/generator and change the fixture consumer to iterate
  over the returned generator.  This change was done in lieu of the new
  ``pytest.yield_fixture`` decorator, see below.

new features:

- experimentally introduce a new ``pytest.yield_fixture`` decorator
  which accepts exactly the same parameters as pytest.fixture but
  mandates a ``yield`` statement instead of a ``return statement`` from
  fixture functions.  This allows direct integration with "with-style"
  context managers in fixture functions and generally avoids registering
  of finalization callbacks in favour of treating the "after-yield" as
  teardown code.  Thanks Andreas Pelme, Vladimir Keleshev, Floris
  Bruynooghe, Ronny Pfannschmidt and many others for discussions.

- allow boolean expression directly with skipif/xfail
  if a "reason" is also specified.  Rework skipping documentation
  to recommend "condition as booleans" because it prevents surprises
  when importing markers between modules.  Specifying conditions
  as strings will remain fully supported.

- reporting: color the last line red or green depending if
  failures/errors occured or everything passed.  thanks Christian
  Theunert.

- make "import pdb ; pdb.set_trace()" work natively wrt capturing (no
  "-s" needed anymore), making ``pytest.set_trace()`` a mere shortcut.

- fix issue181: --pdb now also works on collect errors (and
  on internal errors) .  This was implemented by a slight internal
  refactoring and the introduction of a new hook
  ``pytest_exception_interact`` hook (see next item).

- fix issue341: introduce new experimental hook for IDEs/terminals to
  intercept debugging: ``pytest_exception_interact(node, call, report)``.

- new monkeypatch.setattr() variant to provide a shorter
  invocation for patching out classes/functions from modules:

     monkeypatch.setattr("requests.get", myfunc)

  will replace the "get" function of the "requests" module with ``myfunc``.

- fix issue322: tearDownClass is not run if setUpClass failed. Thanks
  Mathieu Agopian for the initial fix.  Also make all of pytest/nose
  finalizer mimick the same generic behaviour: if a setupX exists and
  fails, don't run teardownX.  This internally introduces a new method
  "node.addfinalizer()" helper which can only be called during the setup
  phase of a node.

- simplify pytest.mark.parametrize() signature: allow to pass a
  CSV-separated string to specify argnames.  For example:
  ``pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected",  [(1,2), (2,3)])``
  works as well as the previous:
  ``pytest.mark.parametrize(("input", "expected"), ...)``.

- add support for setUpModule/tearDownModule detection, thanks Brian Okken.

- integrate tab-completion on options through use of "argcomplete".
  Thanks Anthon van der Neut for the PR.

- change option names to be hyphen-separated long options but keep the
  old spelling backward compatible.  py.test -h will only show the
  hyphenated version, for example "--collect-only" but "--collectonly"
  will remain valid as well (for backward-compat reasons).  Many thanks to
  Anthon van der Neut for the implementation and to Hynek Schlawack for
  pushing us.

- fix issue 308 - allow to mark/xfail/skip individual parameter sets
  when parametrizing.  Thanks Brianna Laugher.

- call new experimental pytest_load_initial_conftests hook to allow
  3rd party plugins to do something before a conftest is loaded.

Bug fixes:

- fix issue358 - capturing options are now parsed more properly
  by using a new parser.parse_known_args method.

- pytest now uses argparse instead of optparse (thanks Anthon) which
  means that "argparse" is added as a dependency if installing into python2.6
  environments or below.

- fix issue333: fix a case of bad unittest/pytest hook interaction.

- PR27: correctly handle nose.SkipTest during collection.  Thanks
  Antonio Cuni, Ronny Pfannschmidt.

- fix issue355: junitxml puts name="pytest" attribute to testsuite tag.

- fix issue336: autouse fixture in plugins should work again.

  from pytest.raises(), thanks Mathieu Agopian.

- remove implicit distribute_setup support from setup.py.

- fix issue305: ignore any problems when writing pyc files.

  partially failed (finalizers would not always be called before)

- fix issue320 - fix class scope for fixtures when mixed with
  module-level functions.  Thanks Anatloy Bubenkoff.

- you can specify "-q" or "-qq" to get different levels of "quieter"
  reporting (thanks Katarzyna Jachim)

- fix issue300 - Fix order of conftest loading when starting py.test
  in a subdirectory.

- fix issue323 - sorting of many module-scoped arg parametrizations

- make sessionfinish hooks execute with the same cwd-context as at
  session start (helps fix plugin behaviour which write output files
  with relative path such as pytest-cov)

- fix issue316 - properly reference collection hooks in docs

- fix issue 306 - cleanup of -k/-m options to only match markers/test
  names/keywords respectively.  Thanks Wouter van Ackooy.

- improved doctest counting for doctests in python modules --
  files without any doctest items will not show up anymore
  and doctest examples are counted as separate test items.
  thanks Danilo Bellini.

- fix issue245 by depending on the released py-1.4.14
  which fixes py.io.dupfile to work with files with no
  mode. Thanks Jason R. Coombs.

- fix junitxml generation when test output contains control characters,
  addressing issue267, thanks Jaap Broekhuizen

- fix issue338: honor --tb style for setup/teardown errors as well.  Thanks Maho.

- fix issue307 - use yaml.safe_load in example, thanks Mark Eichin.

- better parametrize error messages, thanks Brianna Laugher

  ".section(title)" and ".line(msg)" methods to print extra
  information at the end of a test run.

-----------------------------------

- fix issue169: respect --tb=style with setup/teardown errors as well.

- never consider a fixture function for test function collection

- allow re-running of test items / helps to fix pytest-reruntests plugin
  and also help to keep less fixture/resource references alive

- put captured stdout/stderr into junitxml output even for passing tests
  (thanks Adam Goucher)

- Issue 265 - integrate nose setup/teardown with setupstate
  so it doesnt try to teardown if it did not setup

- issue 271 - dont write junitxml on slave nodes

- Issue 274 - dont try to show full doctest example
  when doctest does not know the example location

- issue 280 - disable assertion rewriting on buggy CPython 2.6.0

- inject "getfixture()" helper to retrieve fixtures from doctests,
  thanks Andreas Zeidler

- issue 259 - when assertion rewriting, be consistent with the default
  source encoding of ASCII on Python 2

- issue 251 - report a skip instead of ignoring classes with init

- issue250 unicode/str mixes in parametrization names and values now works

- issue257, assertion-triggered compilation of source ending in a
  comment line doesn't blow up in python2.5 (fixed through py>=1.4.13.dev6)

- fix issue266 - accept unicode in MarkEvaluator expressions

v2.3.4
-----------------------------------

- yielded test functions will now have autouse-fixtures active but
  cannot accept fixtures as funcargs - it's anyway recommended to
  rather use the post-2.0 parametrize features instead of yield, see:
  http://pytest.org/latest/example/parametrize.html

- fix issue91 - add/discuss package/directory level setups in example
- allow to dynamically define markers via
  item.keywords[...]=assignment integrating with "-m" option
- make "-k" accept an expressions the same as with "-m" so that one
  can write: -k "name1 or name2" etc.  This is a slight incompatibility
  if you used special syntax like "TestClass.test_method" which you now
  need to write as -k "TestClass and test_method" to match a certain
  method in a certain test class.

- in tracebacks *,** arg values are now shown next to normal arguments
  (thanks Manuel Jacob)

- fix issue217 - support mock.patch with pytest's fixtures - note that
  you need either mock-1.0.1 or the python3.3 builtin unittest.mock.

- fix issue127 - improve documentation for pytest_addoption() and
  add a ``config.getoption(name)`` helper function for consistency.

v2.3.2
-----------------------------------

  test methods defined

- improve trial support: don't collect its empty
  unittest.TestCase.runTest() method

- "python setup.py test" now works with pytest itself

- fix/improve internal/packaging related bits:

    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 is present

  - add tox.ini to pytest distribution so that ignore-dirs and others config
    bits are properly distributed for maintainers who run pytest-own tests

v2.3.1
-----------------------------------

- fix issue202 - fix regression: using "self" from fixture functions now
  works as expected (it's the same "self" instance that a test method
  which uses the fixture sees)

- skip pexpect using tests (test_pdb.py mostly) on freebsd* systems
  due to pexpect not supporting it properly (hanging)

- link to web pages from --markers output which provides help for
  pytest.mark.* usage.

v2.3.0
-----------------------------------

- fix issue202 - better automatic names for parametrized test functions
- fix issue139 - introduce @pytest.fixture which allows direct scoping
  and parametrization of funcarg factories.

  circumstances with nested directory structures due to path manipulation issues
- fix issue193 skip test functions with were parametrized with empty
  parameter sets

  it is constructed correctly from the original current working dir.
- fix "python setup.py test" example to cause a proper "errno" return
- fix issue165 - fix broken doc links and mention stackoverflow for FAQ
- catch unicode-issues when writing failure representations
  to terminal to prevent the whole session from crashing
- fix xfail/skip confusion: a skip-mark or an imperative pytest.skip
  will now take precedence before xfail-markers because we
  can't determine xfail/xpass status in case of a skip. see also:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11105828/in-py-test-when-i-explicitly-skip-a-test-that-is-marked-as-xfail-how-can-i-get

- always report installed 3rd party plugins in the header of a test run

- fix issue160: a failing setup of an xfail-marked tests should
  be reported as xfail (not xpass)

- fix issue128: show captured output when capsys/capfd are used

- fix issue179: propperly show the dependency chain of factories

- pluginmanager.register(...) now raises ValueError if the
  plugin has been already registered or the name is taken

- fix issue159: improve http://pytest.org/latest/faq.html
  especially with respect to the "magic" history, also mention
  pytest-django, trial and unittest integration.

- reporting refinements:

  - pytest_report_header now receives a "startdir" so that
    you can use startdir.bestrelpath(yourpath) to show
    nice relative path

  - allow plugins to implement both pytest_report_header and
    pytest_sessionstart (sessionstart is invoked first).

  - don't show deselected reason line if there is none

  - py.test -vv will show all of assert comparisations instead of truncating

- allow adding of attributes to test reports such that it also works
  with distributed testing (no upgrade of pytest-xdist needed)

v2.2.1
----------------------------------------

- fix issue99 (in pytest and py) internallerrors with resultlog now
  produce better output - fixed by normalizing pytest_internalerror
  input arguments.
- fix issue97 / traceback issues (in pytest and py) improve traceback output
  in conjunction with jinja2 and cython which hack tracebacks
- fix issue93 (in pytest and pytest-xdist) avoid "delayed teardowns":
  the final test in a test node will now run its teardown directly
  instead of waiting for the end of the session. Thanks Dave Hunt for
  the good reporting and feedback.  The pytest_runtest_protocol as well
  as the pytest_runtest_teardown hooks now have "nextitem" available
  which will be None indicating the end of the test run.
- fix collection crash due to unknown-source collected items, thanks
  to Ralf Schmitt (fixed by depending on a more recent pylib)

v2.2.0
----------------------------------------

- fix issue90: introduce eager tearing down of test items so that
  teardown function are called earlier.
- add an all-powerful metafunc.parametrize function which allows to
  parametrize test function arguments in multiple steps and therefore
  from indepdenent plugins and palces.
- add a @pytest.mark.parametrize helper which allows to easily
  call a test function with different argument values
- Add examples to the "parametrize" example page, including a quick port
  of Test scenarios and the new parametrize function and decorator.
- introduce registration for "pytest.mark.*" helpers via ini-files
  or through plugin hooks.  Also introduce a "--strict" option which
  will treat unregistered markers as errors
  allowing to avoid typos and maintain a well described set of markers
  for your test suite.  See exaples at http://pytest.org/latest/mark.html
  and its links.
- issue50: introduce "-m marker" option to select tests based on markers
  (this is a stricter and more predictable version of '-k' in that "-m"
  only matches complete markers and has more obvious rules for and/or
  semantics.
- new feature to help optimizing the speed of your tests:
  --durations=N option for displaying N slowest test calls
  and setup/teardown methods.
- fix issue87: --pastebin now works with python3
- fix issue89: --pdb with unexpected exceptions in doctest work more sensibly
- fix and cleanup pytest's own test suite to not leak FDs
- fix issue83: link to generated funcarg list
- fix issue74: pyarg module names are now checked against imp.find_module false positives
- fix compatibility with twisted/trial-11.1.0 use cases
- simplify Node.listchain
- simplify junitxml output code by relying on py.xml
- add support for skip properties on unittest classes and functions

- don't cache rewritten modules if bytecode generation is disabled
- fix assertion rewriting in read-only directories
- fix issue59: provide system-out/err tags for junitxml output
- fix issue61: assertion rewriting on boolean operations with 3 or more operands
- you can now build a man page with "cd doc ; make man"

v2.1.0
----------------------------------------------

- fix issue53 call nosestyle setup functions with correct ordering
- fix issue58 and issue59: new assertion code fixes
- merge Benjamin's assertionrewrite branch: now assertions
  for test modules on python 2.6 and above are done by rewriting
  the AST and saving the pyc file before the test module is imported.
  see doc/assert.txt for more info.
- fix issue43: improve doctests with better traceback reporting on
  unexpected exceptions
- fix issue47: timing output in junitxml for test cases is now correct
- fix issue48: typo in MarkInfo repr leading to exception
- fix issue49: avoid confusing error when initizaliation partially fails
- fix issue44: env/username expansion for junitxml file path
- show releaselevel information in test runs for pypy
- reworked doc pages for better navigation and PDF generation
- report KeyboardInterrupt even if interrupted during session startup
- fix issue 35 - provide PDF doc version and download link from index page

v2.0.3
----------------------------------------------

- fix issue38: nicer tracebacks on calls to hooks, particularly early
  configure/sessionstart ones

- fix missing skip reason/meta information in junitxml files, reported
  via http://lists.idyll.org/pipermail/testing-in-python/2011-March/003928.html

- fix issue34: avoid collection failure with "test" prefixed classes
  deriving from object.

- don't require zlib (and other libs) for genscript plugin without
  --genscript actually being used.

- speed up skips (by not doing a full traceback represenation
  internally)

- fix issue37: avoid invalid characters in junitxml's output

v2.0.2
----------------------------------------------

- tackle issue32 - speed up test runs of very quick test functions
  by reducing the relative overhead

- fix issue30 - extended xfail/skipif handling and improved reporting.
  If you have a syntax error in your skip/xfail
  expressions you now get nice error reports.

  Also you can now access module globals from xfail/skipif
  expressions so that this for example works now::

    import pytest
    import mymodule
    @pytest.mark.skipif("mymodule.__version__[0] == "1")
    def test_function():
        pass

  This will not run the test function if the module's version string
  does not start with a "1".  Note that specifying a string instead
  of a boolean expressions allows py.test to report meaningful information
  when summarizing a test run as to what conditions lead to skipping
  (or xfail-ing) tests.

- fix issue28 - setup_method and pytest_generate_tests work together
  The setup_method fixture method now gets called also for
  test function invocations generated from the pytest_generate_tests
  hook.

- fix issue27 - collectonly and keyword-selection (-k) now work together
  Also, if you do "py.test --collectonly -q" you now get a flat list
  of test ids that you can use to paste to the py.test commandline
  in order to execute a particular test.

- fix issue25 avoid reported problems with --pdb and python3.2/encodings output

- fix issue23 - tmpdir argument now works on Python3.2 and WindowsXP
  Starting with Python3.2 os.symlink may be supported. By requiring
  a newer py lib version the py.path.local() implementation acknowledges
  this.

- fixed typos in the docs (thanks Victor Garcia, Brianna Laugher) and particular
  thanks to Laura Creighton who also revieved parts of the documentation.

- fix slighly wrong output of verbose progress reporting for classes
  (thanks Amaury)

- more precise (avoiding of) deprecation warnings for node.Class|Function accesses

- avoid std unittest assertion helper code in tracebacks (thanks Ronny)

v2.0.1
----------------------------------------------

- refine and unify initial capturing so that it works nicely
  even if the logging module is used on an early-loaded conftest.py
  file or plugin.
- allow to omit "()" in test ids to allow for uniform test ids
  as produced by Alfredo's nice pytest.vim plugin.
- fix issue12 - show plugin versions with "--version" and
  "--traceconfig" and also document how to add extra information
  to reporting test header
- fix issue17 (import-* reporting issue on python3) by
  requiring py>1.4.0 (1.4.1 is going to include it)
- fix issue10 (numpy arrays truth checking) by refining
  assertion interpretation in py lib
- fix issue15: make nose compatibility tests compatible
  with python3 (now that nose-1.0 supports python3)
- remove somewhat surprising "same-conftest" detection because
  it ignores conftest.py when they appear in several subdirs.
- improve assertions ("not in"), thanks Floris Bruynooghe
- improve behaviour/warnings when running on top of "python -OO"
  (assertions and docstrings are turned off, leading to potential
  false positives)
- introduce a pytest_cmdline_processargs(args) hook
  to allow dynamic computation of command line arguments.
  This fixes a regression because py.test prior to 2.0
  allowed to set command line options from conftest.py
  files which so far pytest-2.0 only allowed from ini-files now.
- fix issue7: assert failures in doctest modules.
  unexpected failures in doctests will not generally
  show nicer, i.e. within the doctest failing context.
- fix issue9: setup/teardown functions for an xfail-marked
  test will report as xfail if they fail but report as normally
  passing (not xpassing) if they succeed.  This only is true
  for "direct" setup/teardown invocations because teardown_class/
  teardown_module cannot closely relate to a single test.
- fix issue14: no logging errors at process exit
- refinements to "collecting" output on non-ttys
- refine internal plugin registration and --traceconfig output
- introduce a mechanism to prevent/unregister plugins from the
  command line, see http://pytest.org/plugins.html#cmdunregister
- activate resultlog plugin by default
- fix regression wrt yielded tests which due to the
  collection-before-running semantics were not
  setup as with pytest 1.3.4.  Note, however, that
  the recommended and much cleaner way to do test
  parametraization remains the "pytest_generate_tests"
  mechanism, see the docs.

v2.0.0
----------------------------------------------

- pytest-2.0 is now its own package and depends on pylib-2.0
- new ability: python -m pytest / python -m pytest.main ability
- new python invcation: pytest.main(args, plugins) to load
  some custom plugins early.
- try harder to run unittest test suites in a more compatible manner
  by deferring setup/teardown semantics to the unittest package.
  also work harder to run twisted/trial and Django tests which
  should now basically work by default.
- introduce a new way to set config options via ini-style files,
  by default setup.cfg and tox.ini files are searched.  The old
  ways (certain environment variables, dynamic conftest.py reading
  is removed).
- add a new "-q" option which decreases verbosity and prints a more
  nose/unittest-style "dot" output.
- fix issue135 - marks now work with unittest test cases as well
- fix issue126 - introduce py.test.set_trace() to trace execution via
  PDB during the running of tests even if capturing is ongoing.
- fix issue123 - new "python -m py.test" invocation for py.test
  (requires Python 2.5 or above)
- fix issue124 - make reporting more resilient against tests opening
  files on filedescriptor 1 (stdout).
- fix issue109 - sibling conftest.py files will not be loaded.
  (and Directory collectors cannot be customized anymore from a Directory's
  conftest.py - this needs to happen at least one level up).
- introduce (customizable) assertion failure representations and enhance
  output on assertion failures for comparisons and other cases (Floris Bruynooghe)
- nose-plugin: pass through type-signature failures in setup/teardown
  functions instead of not calling them (Ed Singleton)
- remove py.test.collect.Directory (follows from a major refactoring
  and simplification of the collection process)
- majorly reduce py.test core code, shift function/python testing to own plugin
- fix issue88 (finding custom test nodes from command line arg)
- refine 'tmpdir' creation, will now create basenames better associated
  with test names (thanks Ronny)
- "xpass" (unexpected pass) tests don't cause exitcode!=0
- fix issue131 / issue60 - importing doctests in __init__ files used as namespace packages
- fix issue93 stdout/stderr is captured while importing conftest.py
- fix bug: unittest collected functions now also can have "pytestmark"
  applied at class/module level
- add ability to use "class" level for cached_setup helper
- fix strangeness: mark.* objects are now immutable, create new instances

v1.3.4
----------------------------------------------

- fix issue111: improve install documentation for windows
- fix issue119: fix custom collectability of __init__.py as a module
- fix issue116: --doctestmodules work with __init__.py files as well
- fix issue115: unify internal exception passthrough/catching/GeneratorExit
- fix issue118: new --tb=native for presenting cpython-standard exceptions

v1.3.3
----------------------------------------------

- fix issue113: assertion representation problem with triple-quoted strings
  (and possibly other cases)
- make conftest loading detect that a conftest file with the same
  content was already loaded, avoids surprises in nested directory structures
  which can be produced e.g. by Hudson. It probably removes the need to use
  --confcutdir in most cases.
- fix terminal coloring for win32
  (thanks Michael Foord for reporting)
- fix weirdness: make terminal width detection work on stdout instead of stdin
  (thanks Armin Ronacher for reporting)
- remove trailing whitespace in all py/text distribution files

v1.3.2
----------------------------------------------

New features
++++++++++++++++++

- fix issue103:  introduce py.test.raises as context manager, examples::

    with py.test.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
        x = 0
        1 / x

    with py.test.raises(RuntimeError) as excinfo:
        call_something()

    # you may do extra checks on excinfo.value|type|traceback here

  (thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt)

- Funcarg factories can now dynamically apply a marker to a
  test invocation.  This is for example useful if a factory
  provides parameters to a test which are expected-to-fail::

    def pytest_funcarg__arg(request):
        request.applymarker(py.test.mark.xfail(reason="flaky config"))
        ...

    def test_function(arg):
        ...

- improved error reporting on collection and import errors. This makes
  use of a more general mechanism, namely that for custom test item/collect
  nodes ``node.repr_failure(excinfo)`` is now uniformly called so that you can
  override it to return a string error representation of your choice
  which is going to be reported as a (red) string.

- introduce '--junitprefix=STR' option to prepend a prefix
  to all reports in the junitxml file.

Bug fixes / Maintenance
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- make tests and the ``pytest_recwarn`` plugin in particular fully compatible
  to Python2.7 (if you use the ``recwarn`` funcarg warnings will be enabled so that
  you can properly check for their existence in a cross-python manner).
- refine --pdb: ignore xfailed tests, unify its TB-reporting and
  don't display failures again at the end.
- fix assertion interpretation with the ** operator (thanks Benjamin Peterson)
- fix issue105 assignment on the same line as a failing assertion (thanks Benjamin Peterson)
- fix issue104 proper escaping for test names in junitxml plugin (thanks anonymous)
- fix issue57 -f|--looponfail to work with xpassing tests (thanks Ronny)
- fix issue92 collectonly reporter and --pastebin (thanks Benjamin Peterson)
- fix py.code.compile(source) to generate unique filenames
- fix assertion re-interp problems on PyPy, by defering code
  compilation to the (overridable) Frame.eval class. (thanks Amaury Forgeot)
- fix py.path.local.pyimport() to work with directories
- streamline py.path.local.mkdtemp implementation and usage
- don't print empty lines when showing junitxml-filename
- add optional boolean ignore_errors parameter to py.path.local.remove
- fix terminal writing on win32/python2.4
- py.process.cmdexec() now tries harder to return properly encoded unicode objects
  on all python versions
- install plain py.test/py.which scripts also for Jython, this helps to
  get canonical script paths in virtualenv situations
- make path.bestrelpath(path) return ".", note that when calling
  X.bestrelpath the assumption is that X is a directory.
- make initial conftest discovery ignore "--" prefixed arguments
- fix resultlog plugin when used in an multicpu/multihost xdist situation
  (thanks Jakub Gustak)
- perform distributed testing related reporting in the xdist-plugin
  rather than having dist-related code in the generic py.test
  distribution
- fix homedir detection on Windows
- ship distribute_setup.py version 0.6.13

v1.3.1
---------------------------------------------

New features
++++++++++++++++++

- issue91: introduce new py.test.xfail(reason) helper
  to imperatively mark a test as expected to fail. Can
  be used from within setup and test functions. This is
  useful especially for parametrized tests when certain
  configurations are expected-to-fail.  In this case the
  declarative approach with the @py.test.mark.xfail cannot
  be used as it would mark all configurations as xfail.

- issue102: introduce new --maxfail=NUM option to stop
  test runs after NUM failures.  This is a generalization
  of the '-x' or '--exitfirst' option which is now equivalent
  to '--maxfail=1'.  Both '-x' and '--maxfail' will
  now also print a line near the end indicating the Interruption.

- issue89: allow py.test.mark decorators to be used on classes
  (class decorators were introduced with python2.6) and
  also allow to have multiple markers applied at class/module level
  by specifying a list.

- improve and refine letter reporting in the progress bar:
  .  pass
  f  failed test
  s  skipped tests (reminder: use for dependency/platform mismatch only)
  x  xfailed test (test that was expected to fail)
  X  xpassed test (test that was expected to fail but passed)

  You can use any combination of 'fsxX' with the '-r' extended
  reporting option. The xfail/xpass results will show up as
  skipped tests in the junitxml output - which also fixes
  issue99.

- make py.test.cmdline.main() return the exitstatus instead of raising
  SystemExit and also allow it to be called multiple times.  This of
  course requires that your application and tests are properly teared
  down and don't have global state.

Fixes / Maintenance
++++++++++++++++++++++

- improved traceback presentation:
  - improved and unified reporting for "--tb=short" option
  - Errors during test module imports are much shorter, (using --tb=short style)
  - raises shows shorter more relevant tracebacks
  - --fulltrace now more systematically makes traces longer / inhibits cutting

- improve support for raises and other dynamically compiled code by
  manipulating python's linecache.cache instead of the previous
  rather hacky way of creating custom code objects.  This makes
  it seemlessly work on Jython and PyPy where it previously didn't.

- fix issue96: make capturing more resilient against Control-C
  interruptions (involved somewhat substantial refactoring
  to the underlying capturing functionality to avoid race
  conditions).

- fix chaining of conditional skipif/xfail decorators - so it works now
  as expected to use multiple @py.test.mark.skipif(condition) decorators,
  including specific reporting which of the conditions lead to skipping.

- fix issue95: late-import zlib so that it's not required
  for general py.test startup.

- fix issue94: make reporting more robust against bogus source code
  (and internally be more careful when presenting unexpected byte sequences)


v1.3.0
---------------------------------------------

- deprecate --report option in favour of a new shorter and easier to
  remember -r option: it takes a string argument consisting of any
  combination of 'xfsX' characters.  They relate to the single chars
  you see during the dotted progress printing and will print an extra line
  per test at the end of the test run.  This extra line indicates the exact
  position or test ID that you directly paste to the py.test cmdline in order
  to re-run a particular test.

- allow external plugins to register new hooks via the new
  pytest_addhooks(pluginmanager) hook.  The new release of
  the pytest-xdist plugin for distributed and looponfailing
  testing requires this feature.

- add a new pytest_ignore_collect(path, config) hook to allow projects and
  plugins to define exclusion behaviour for their directory structure -
  for example you may define in a conftest.py this method::

        def pytest_ignore_collect(path):
            return path.check(link=1)

  to prevent even a collection try of any tests in symlinked dirs.

- new pytest_pycollect_makemodule(path, parent) hook for
  allowing customization of the Module collection object for a
  matching test module.

- extend and refine xfail mechanism:
  ``@py.test.mark.xfail(run=False)`` do not run the decorated test
  ``@py.test.mark.xfail(reason="...")`` prints the reason string in xfail summaries
  specifiying ``--runxfail`` on command line virtually ignores xfail markers

- expose (previously internal) commonly useful methods:
  py.io.get_terminal_with() -> return terminal width
  py.io.ansi_print(...) -> print colored/bold text on linux/win32
  py.io.saferepr(obj) -> return limited representation string

- expose test outcome related exceptions as py.test.skip.Exception,
  py.test.raises.Exception etc., useful mostly for plugins
  doing special outcome interpretation/tweaking

- (issue85) fix junitxml plugin to handle tests with non-ascii output

- fix/refine python3 compatibility (thanks Benjamin Peterson)

- fixes for making the jython/win32 combination work, note however:
  jython2.5.1/win32 does not provide a command line launcher, see
  http://bugs.jython.org/issue1491 . See pylib install documentation
  for how to work around.

- fixes for handling of unicode exception values and unprintable objects

- (issue87) fix unboundlocal error in assertionold code

- (issue86) improve documentation for looponfailing

- refine IO capturing: stdin-redirect pseudo-file now has a NOP close() method

- ship distribute_setup.py version 0.6.10

- added links to the new capturelog and coverage plugins


v1.2.0
---------------------------------------------

- refined usage and options for "py.cleanup"::

    py.cleanup     # remove "*.pyc" and "*$py.class" (jython) files
    py.cleanup -e .swp -e .cache # also remove files with these extensions
    py.cleanup -s  # remove "build" and "dist" directory next to setup.py files
    py.cleanup -d  # also remove empty directories
    py.cleanup -a  # synonym for "-s -d -e 'pip-log.txt'"
    py.cleanup -n  # dry run, only show what would be removed

- add a new option "py.test --funcargs" which shows available funcargs
  and their help strings (docstrings on their respective factory function)
  for a given test path

- display a short and concise traceback if a funcarg lookup fails

- early-load "conftest.py" files in non-dot first-level sub directories.
  allows to conveniently keep and access test-related options in a ``test``
  subdir and still add command line options.

- fix issue67: new super-short traceback-printing option: "--tb=line" will print a single line for each failing (python) test indicating its filename, lineno and the failure value

- fix issue78: always call python-level teardown functions even if the
  according setup failed.  This includes refinements for calling setup_module/class functions
  which will now only be called once instead of the previous behaviour where they'd be called
  multiple times if they raise an exception (including a Skipped exception).  Any exception
  will be re-corded and associated with all tests in the according module/class scope.

- fix issue63: assume <40 columns to be a bogus terminal width, default to 80

- fix pdb debugging to be in the correct frame on raises-related errors

- update apipkg.py to fix an issue where recursive imports might
  unnecessarily break importing

- fix plugin links

v1.1.1
---------------------------------------------

- moved dist/looponfailing from py.test core into a new
  separately released pytest-xdist plugin.

- new junitxml plugin: --junitxml=path will generate a junit style xml file
  which is processable e.g. by the Hudson CI system.

- new option: --genscript=path will generate a standalone py.test script
  which will not need any libraries installed.  thanks to Ralf Schmitt.

- new option: --ignore will prevent specified path from collection.
  Can be specified multiple times.

- new option: --confcutdir=dir will make py.test only consider conftest
  files that are relative to the specified dir.

- new funcarg: "pytestconfig" is the pytest config object for access
  to command line args and can now be easily used in a test.

- install 'py.test' and `py.which` with a ``-$VERSION`` suffix to
  disambiguate between Python3, python2.X, Jython and PyPy installed versions.

- new "pytestconfig" funcarg allows access to test config object

- new "pytest_report_header" hook can return additional lines
  to be displayed at the header of a test run.

- (experimental) allow "py.test path::name1::name2::..." for pointing
  to a test within a test collection directly.  This might eventually
  evolve as a full substitute to "-k" specifications.

- streamlined plugin loading: order is now as documented in
  customize.html: setuptools, ENV, commandline, conftest.
  also setuptools entry point names are turned to canonical namees ("pytest_*")

- automatically skip tests that need 'capfd' but have no os.dup

- allow pytest_generate_tests to be defined in classes as well

- deprecate usage of 'disabled' attribute in favour of pytestmark
- deprecate definition of Directory, Module, Class and Function nodes
  in conftest.py files.  Use pytest collect hooks instead.

- collection/item node specific runtest/collect hooks are only called exactly
  on matching conftest.py files, i.e. ones which are exactly below
  the filesystem path of an item

- change: the first pytest_collect_directory hook to return something
  will now prevent further hooks to be called.

- change: figleaf plugin now requires --figleaf to run.  Also
  change its long command line options to be a bit shorter (see py.test -h).

- change: pytest doctest plugin is now enabled by default and has a
  new option --doctest-glob to set a pattern for file matches.

- change: remove internal py._* helper vars, only keep py._pydir

- robustify capturing to survive if custom pytest_runtest_setup
  code failed and prevented the capturing setup code from running.

- make py.test.* helpers provided by default plugins visible early -
  works transparently both for pydoc and for interactive sessions
  which will regularly see e.g. py.test.mark and py.test.importorskip.

- simplify internal plugin manager machinery
- simplify internal collection tree by introducing a RootCollector node

- fix assert reinterpreation that sees a call containing "keyword=..."

- fix issue66: invoke pytest_sessionstart and pytest_sessionfinish
  hooks on slaves during dist-testing, report module/session teardown
  hooks correctly.

- fix issue65: properly handle dist-testing if no
  execnet/py lib installed remotely.

- skip some install-tests if no execnet is available

- fix docs, fix internal bin/ script generation


v1.1.0
---------------------------------------------

- introduce automatic plugin registration via 'pytest11'
  entrypoints via setuptools' pkg_resources.iter_entry_points

- fix py.test dist-testing to work with execnet >= 1.0.0b4

- re-introduce py.test.cmdline.main() for better backward compatibility

- svn paths: fix a bug with path.check(versioned=True) for svn paths,
  allow '%' in svn paths, make svnwc.update() default to interactive mode
  like in 1.0.x and add svnwc.update(interactive=False) to inhibit interaction.

- refine distributed tarball to contain test and no pyc files

- try harder to have deprecation warnings for py.compat.* accesses
  report a correct location

v1.0.2
---------------------------------------------

* adjust and improve docs

* remove py.rest tool and internal namespace - it was
  never really advertised and can still be used with
  the old release if needed.  If there is interest
  it could be revived into its own tool i guess.

* fix issue48 and issue59: raise an Error if the module
  from an imported test file does not seem to come from
  the filepath - avoids "same-name" confusion that has
  been reported repeatedly

* merged Ronny's nose-compatibility hacks: now
  nose-style setup_module() and setup() functions are
  supported

* introduce generalized py.test.mark function marking

* reshuffle / refine command line grouping

* deprecate parser.addgroup in favour of getgroup which creates option group

* add --report command line option that allows to control showing of skipped/xfailed sections

* generalized skipping: a new way to mark python functions with skipif or xfail
  at function, class and modules level based on platform or sys-module attributes.

* extend py.test.mark decorator to allow for positional args

* introduce and test "py.cleanup -d" to remove empty directories

* fix issue #59 - robustify unittest test collection

* make bpython/help interaction work by adding an __all__ attribute
  to ApiModule, cleanup initpkg

* use MIT license for pylib, add some contributors

* remove py.execnet code and substitute all usages with 'execnet' proper

* fix issue50 - cached_setup now caches more to expectations
  for test functions with multiple arguments.

* merge Jarko's fixes, issue #45 and #46

* add the ability to specify a path for py.lookup to search in

* fix a funcarg cached_setup bug probably only occuring
  in distributed testing and "module" scope with teardown.

* many fixes and changes for making the code base python3 compatible,
  many thanks to Benjamin Peterson for helping with this.

* consolidate builtins implementation to be compatible with >=2.3,
  add helpers to ease keeping 2 and 3k compatible code

* deprecate py.compat.doctest|subprocess|textwrap|optparse

* deprecate py.magic.autopath, remove py/magic directory

* move pytest assertion handling to py/code and a pytest_assertion
  plugin, add "--no-assert" option, deprecate py.magic namespaces
  in favour of (less) py.code ones.

* consolidate and cleanup py/code classes and files

* cleanup py/misc, move tests to bin-for-dist

* introduce delattr/delitem/delenv methods to py.test's monkeypatch funcarg

* consolidate py.log implementation, remove old approach.

* introduce py.io.TextIO and py.io.BytesIO for distinguishing between
  text/unicode and byte-streams (uses underlying standard lib io.*
  if available)

* make py.unittest_convert helper script available which converts "unittest.py"
  style files into the simpler assert/direct-test-classes py.test/nosetests
  style.  The script was written by Laura Creighton.

* simplified internal localpath implementation

v1.0.2
-------------------------------------------

* fixing packaging issues, triggered by fedora redhat packaging,
  also added doc, examples and contrib dirs to the tarball.

* added a documentation link to the new django plugin.

v1.0.1
-------------------------------------------

* added a 'pytest_nose' plugin which handles nose.SkipTest,
  nose-style function/method/generator setup/teardown and
  tries to report functions correctly.

* capturing of unicode writes or encoded strings to sys.stdout/err
  work better, also terminalwriting was adapted and somewhat
  unified between windows and linux.

* improved documentation layout and content a lot

* added a "--help-config" option to show conftest.py / ENV-var names for
  all longopt cmdline options, and some special conftest.py variables.
  renamed 'conf_capture' conftest setting to 'option_capture' accordingly.

* fix issue #27: better reporting on non-collectable items given on commandline
  (e.g. pyc files)

* fix issue #33: added --version flag (thanks Benjamin Peterson)

* fix issue #32: adding support for "incomplete" paths to wcpath.status()

* "Test" prefixed classes are *not* collected by default anymore if they
  have an __init__ method

* monkeypatch setenv() now accepts a "prepend" parameter

* improved reporting of collection error tracebacks

* simplified multicall mechanism and plugin architecture,
  renamed some internal methods and argnames

v1.0.0
-------------------------------------------

* more terse reporting try to show filesystem path relatively to current dir
* improve xfail output a bit

v1.0.0b9
-------------------------------------------

* cleanly handle and report final teardown of test setup

* fix svn-1.6 compat issue with py.path.svnwc().versioned()
  (thanks Wouter Vanden Hove)

* setup/teardown or collection problems now show as ERRORs
  or with big "E"'s in the progress lines.  they are reported
  and counted separately.

* dist-testing: properly handle test items that get locally
  collected but cannot be collected on the remote side - often
  due to platform/dependency reasons

* simplified py.test.mark API - see keyword plugin documentation

* integrate better with logging: capturing now by default captures
  test functions and their immediate setup/teardown in a single stream

* capsys and capfd funcargs now have a readouterr() and a close() method
  (underlyingly py.io.StdCapture/FD objects are used which grew a
  readouterr() method as well to return snapshots of captured out/err)

* make assert-reinterpretation work better with comparisons not
  returning bools (reported with numpy from thanks maciej fijalkowski)

* reworked per-test output capturing into the pytest_iocapture.py plugin
  and thus removed capturing code from config object

* item.repr_failure(excinfo) instead of item.repr_failure(excinfo, outerr)


v1.0.0b8
-------------------------------------------

* pytest_unittest-plugin is now enabled by default

* introduced pytest_keyboardinterrupt hook and
  refined pytest_sessionfinish hooked, added tests.

* workaround a buggy logging module interaction ("closing already closed
  files").  Thanks to Sridhar Ratnakumar for triggering.

* if plugins use "py.test.importorskip" for importing
  a dependency only a warning will be issued instead
  of exiting the testing process.

* many improvements to docs:
  - refined funcargs doc , use the term "factory" instead of "provider"
  - added a new talk/tutorial doc page
  - better download page
  - better plugin docstrings
  - added new plugins page and automatic doc generation script

* fixed teardown problem related to partially failing funcarg setups
  (thanks MrTopf for reporting), "pytest_runtest_teardown" is now
  always invoked even if the "pytest_runtest_setup" failed.

* tweaked doctest output for docstrings in py modules,
  thanks Radomir.

v1.0.0b7
-------------------------------------------

* renamed py.test.xfail back to py.test.mark.xfail to avoid
  two ways to decorate for xfail

* re-added py.test.mark decorator for setting keywords on functions
  (it was actually documented so removing it was not nice)

* remove scope-argument from request.addfinalizer() because
  request.cached_setup has the scope arg. TOOWTDI.

* perform setup finalization before reporting failures

* apply modified patches from Andreas Kloeckner to allow
  test functions to have no func_code (#22) and to make
  "-k" and function keywords work  (#20)

* apply patch from Daniel Peolzleithner (issue #23)

* resolve issue #18, multiprocessing.Manager() and
  redirection clash

* make __name__ == "__channelexec__" for remote_exec code

v1.0.0b3
-------------------------------------------

* plugin classes are removed: one now defines
  hooks directly in conftest.py or global pytest_*.py
  files.

* added new pytest_namespace(config) hook that allows
  to inject helpers directly to the py.test.* namespace.

* documented and refined many hooks

* added new style of generative tests via
  pytest_generate_tests hook that integrates
  well with function arguments.


v1.0.0b1
-------------------------------------------

* introduced new "funcarg" setup method,
  see doc/test/funcarg.txt

* introduced plugin architecuture and many
  new py.test plugins, see
  doc/test/plugins.txt

* teardown_method is now guaranteed to get
  called after a test method has run.

* new method: py.test.importorskip(mod,minversion)
  will either import or call py.test.skip()

* completely revised internal py.test architecture

* new py.process.ForkedFunc object allowing to
  fork execution of a function to a sub process
  and getting a result back.

XXX lots of things missing here XXX

v0.9.2
-------------------------------------------

* refined installation and metadata, created new setup.py,
  now based on setuptools/ez_setup (thanks to Ralf Schmitt
  for his support).

* improved the way of making py.* scripts available in
  windows environments, they are now added to the
  Scripts directory as ".cmd" files.

* py.path.svnwc.status() now is more complete and
  uses xml output from the 'svn' command if available
  (Guido Wesdorp)

* fix for py.path.svn* to work with svn 1.5
  (Chris Lamb)

* fix path.relto(otherpath) method on windows to
  use normcase for checking if a path is relative.

* py.test's traceback is better parseable from editors
  (follows the filenames:LINENO: MSG convention)
  (thanks to Osmo Salomaa)

* fix to javascript-generation, "py.test --runbrowser"
  should work more reliably now

* removed previously accidentally added
  py.test.broken and py.test.notimplemented helpers.

* there now is a py.__version__ attribute
