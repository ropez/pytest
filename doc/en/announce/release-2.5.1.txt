pytest-2.5.1: fixes and new home page styling
===========================================================================

pytest-2.5.1, a mature testing tool with more than a 1000 tests 
against itself, maintains the "zero-reported-bugs" promise by fixing
the three bugs reported since the last release a few days ago.  It also 
features a new home page styling implemented by Tobias Bieniek, based on
original work from Armin Ronacher.  Check it out:

    http://pytest.org

If you have anything more to improve styling and docs, 
we'd be very happy to merge further pull requests.

On the coding side, the release also contains a little enhancement to
fixture decorators allowing to directly influence generation of test
ids, thanks to Floris Bruynooghe.  Other thanks for helping with 
this release also go to Anatoly Bubenkoff and Ronny Pfannschmidt.

As usual, you can upgrade from pypi via::

    pip install -U pytest

have fun and a nice remaining time of the year!
