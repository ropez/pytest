pytest-2.4.2: colorama on windows, plugin/tmpdir fixes
===========================================================================

pytest-2.4.2 is another bug-fixing release:

- fix "-k" matching of tests where "repr" and "attr" and other names would
  cause wrong matches because of an internal implementation quirk
  (don't ask) which is now properly implemented. fixes issue345.

- avoid tmpdir fixture to create too long filenames especially
  when parametrization is used (issue354)

- fix pytest-pep8 and pytest-flakes / pytest interactions
  (collection names in mark plugin was assuming an item always
  has a function which is not true for those plugins etc.)
  Thanks Andi Zeidler.

- introduce node.get_marker/node.add_marker API for plugins
  like pytest-pep8 and pytest-flakes to avoid the messy
  details of the node.keywords  pseudo-dicts.  Adapated
  docs.

- remove attempt to "dup" stdout at startup as it's icky.
  the normal capturing should catch enough possibilities
  of tests messing up standard FDs. 

as usual, docs at http://pytest.org and upgrades via::

    pip install -U pytest

have fun,
